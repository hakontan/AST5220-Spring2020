See Examples.cpp (make examples; ./examples to compile it and run) for examples on how to make splines, solve ODEs, etc.
and the functionality of the stuff supplied with this template

The code runs from Main.cpp. See this file for the order of things to implement.

Compile the code running ( make )

If you want to compile this on your computer you need to install the GSL library first. See below for instructions.

In the last module you will also need a library for Bessel functions (the GSL one often fails for very large inputs), if 
COMPLEX_BESSEL is defined in the makefile then you will have to have this library installed:

  https://github.com/joeydumont/complex_bessel

If you don't have this then just comment out the two lines below ( "Add bessel function library" ) in the Makefile

===================================================
INSTALL GSL LOCALLY:
===================================================

Run the following commands in order:

# Go the the home directory
cd $HOME

# Make a local folder to hold libraries
mkdir local

# Enter this directory
cd local

# Download the code (if you don't have wget you need to get the file to this dir by other means)
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.6.tar.gz

# Unzip the code
tar -xvf gsl-2.6.tar.gz

# You should now have the gsl-2.6 folder. Enter it
cd gsl-2.6

# Run the configure script
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

# Compile and install it
make ; make install

In the CMB code Makefile change the include and lib paths to:
    INC  = -I$(HOME)/local/include
    LIBS = -L$(HOME)/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas

Now try to compile by running make and run the code as
  ./cmb

If this fails with "libgsl.so not found" then run the command
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib"

and try to run ./cmb again and it should work. To avoid having
to run this command every time you open a new terminal open
the $HOME/.bashrc file and add this line to the end of the file
and it will load everytime you open a new window

===================================================

===================================================
INSTALL COMPLEX BESSEL LOCALLY:
===================================================
cd $HOME
mkdir local
cd local
git clone https://github.com/joeydumont/complex_bessel
cd complex_bessel
See the README.md file for how to proceed
